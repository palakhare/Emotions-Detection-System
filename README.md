EMOTION DETECTION SYSTEM

A real-time AI web application that detects human emotions from text or video (facial expressions) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning.
üåü Overview

The Emotion Detection System identifies emotions from:

Facial Expressions (Real-Time Video) ‚Äì Captures live webcam feed to detect emotions such as Happy, Sad, Angry, Surprise, Neutral, Fear, Disgust.

Text Messages ‚Äì Analyzes the emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral) of a given text input.

This system can be integrated into mental health apps, customer support platforms, e-learning tools, and entertainment applications to enhance user experience.

‚ú® Features

‚úÖ Dual Mode: Detect emotions from live video or text input
‚úÖ Real-time face detection & emotion classification using CNN
‚úÖ Pre-trained NLP model for sentiment analysis on text
‚úÖ Lightweight web interface for easy use
‚úÖ Visual emotion probability graph for each detection
‚úÖ Option to save analysis reports for research or review
